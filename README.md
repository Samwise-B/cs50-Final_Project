# Capture The Flag (CTF) Educational Hacking Game

This project is a **full-stack web application** designed as an educational Capture The Flag (CTF) hacking game, where players identify vulnerabilities to "capture" flags hidden within the system. This project demonstrates my abilities in **web development, security, and DevOps** by creating a controlled environment with realistic vulnerabilities for educational purposes.

## Project Overview

In this CTF game, the objective is to discover hidden "flags"â€”unique strings that serve as keys to advancing through three increasingly challenging stages. Each stage requires players to exploit a specific security vulnerability in the system, honing their understanding of **cybersecurity fundamentals** and **web application vulnerabilities**.

### Vulnerabilities Modeled
This application intentionally includes three common security vulnerabilities to teach players about the nature and risks of each exploit:
1. **Poor Access Control**: Players must bypass weak authentication mechanisms to access restricted areas.
2. **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**: By exploiting path traversal, players can view files that should be inaccessible.
3. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: In the final stage, players uncover and execute code remotely on the server.

## Technologies Used

This CTF game was developed using the following stack:
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for rapid development and prototyping of the application.
- **SQLite with SQLAlchemy**: A relational database via SQLAlchemy for easy data manipulation and user progress tracking.
- **Bootstrap**: A responsive, mobile-first CSS framework for clean, user-friendly UI design.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
1. **Full-Stack Web Development**: Designed and implemented both backend and frontend, creating a cohesive, interactive experience.
2. **Application Security**: Built a practical application with real security flaws, showcasing an understanding of web security, common vulnerabilities, and mitigations.
3. **Database Management**: Used SQLAlchemy to interact with SQLite, demonstrating competence in data storage, retrieval, and management within a secure environment.
4. **DevOps & Dependency Management**: Managed dependencies, installation, and deployment processes to ensure the game runs smoothly in a controlled virtual environment.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ctf-hacking-game.git
   cd ctf-hacking-game
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the Application**: After installing the dependencies, start the application:
   ```
   python app.py
The application is best run in a virtual machine to ensure isolation and security, as it contains intentional vulnerabilities.

# Learning Objectives and Takeaways
This project showcases a range of skills relevant to full-stack web development, cybersecurity, and DevOps. By developing this CTF game, I demonstrated:
- Proficiency in Vulnerability Modeling: Created a realistic environment for learning and understanding common vulnerabilities, showcasing knowledge of exploit mechanisms and application security.
- Backend Development: Developed a secure backend structure using Flask, ensuring smooth interaction between the application and the database.
- User-Centric Frontend Design: Used Bootstrap to create an intuitive user interface that guides players through the CTF stages.
- Efficient Deployment Practices: Managed dependencies and environment isolation, which are crucial for setting up applications with deliberate vulnerabilities.
This project is a practical example of my abilities to design, develop, and deploy secure, interactive applications, especially suited for educational purposes in cybersecurity.
