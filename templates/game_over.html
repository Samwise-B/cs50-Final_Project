        <h1>Welcome to the Main Frame</h1>
        <p>
            Congratulations, you have successfully completed all three levels and achieved remote code execution. Unless you cheated.
            Either way, I hope this was a learning experience for anyone that chose to play. If you enjoyed this, you might want to look into CTFs. CTFs are generally
            more complicated than this game but are an interesting approach at learning cybersecurity.

            I haven't played CTFs yet, I felt I needed to learn more about the basic of web programming but these are some popular sites I have seen recommended multiple times for
            learning about cybersecurity.

            You should also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w">LiveOverflow</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA">IppSec</a> both of them have good
            content on hacking. LiveOverflow has great videos on how to break down learning cybersecurity into more digestable chunks, I recommend that for anyone who's a novice, like me.

        <h3>Excerpt From "The Hacker's Manifesto"</h1>
        <p>
            "I made a
discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does
what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up.
Not because it doesn't like me, or feels threatened by me, or thinks I'm
a smart ass, or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here. Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike. And then it happened... a
door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin
through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from
the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is
it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even if I've
never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I
know you all... Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all
alike... You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby
food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you
did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated
by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to
teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in
the desert. This is our world now... the world of the electron and the
switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing
without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by
profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you
call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals.
We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious
bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars,
you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our
own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that
of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and
think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you,
something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is
my manifesto.  You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all...
after all, we're all alike."

This was the last published file written by The Mentor. Shortly after
releasing it, he was busted by the FBI.
